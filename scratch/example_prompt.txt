Here are the parameters of an existing grid:
        "origin_coords": {"x": 0, "y": 0},
        "direction": "east",
        "existing_neighbors": [],

        Return JSON for new locations in the following structure:
        {
          "locations": [
            {
              "coords": {"x": "new x", "y": "new y"},
              "reverse_coords": {"x": "reverse x", "y": "reverse y"},
              "name": "Fictional location",
              "description": "Detailed and rich location description",
              "type": "outdoor: forest edge",
              "features": [{"type": "feature", "description": "Feature description"}],
              "sounds": ["sound1", "sound2"],
              "smells": ["smell1", "smell2"]
            }
          ]
        }

        Generate the new location in the given direction based on the origin coordinates, and then generate
        the 8 surrounding neighbors (north, south, east, west, northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast)
        only around the **newly created location** if they are not in existing_neighbors.

        Provide rich and detailed descriptions for all locations like in a story to enhance immersion. Ensure
        smooth transitions between terrain types (e.g., no abrupt changes like snow to desert or forest to river).
        If the requested direction is occupied, return this error structure: { "error": "Location occupied" }.
